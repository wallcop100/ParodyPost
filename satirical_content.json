Must love loud music and long phone conversations at 3am. \n\nDesperately seeking a car that breaks down at least once a week for an added adrenaline rush during your morning commute. Bonus points if the air conditioning doesn't work. \n\nIn search of a job where you are constantly interrupted by coworkers who want to tell you about their personal problems while you are on a tight deadline. Competitive salary and no paid time off. \n\nISO a vacation destination with overcrowded beaches, overpriced resorts, and rude locals who refuse to speak English. Must have limited cell service and be swarming with tourists taking selfies."
